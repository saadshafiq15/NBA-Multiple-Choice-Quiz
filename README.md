# NBA-Multiple-Choice-Quiz
This Java program that is a quiz is a computer program that presents users with a series of questions and allows them to test their knowledge on a particular subject. Quizzes can be used for a variety of purposes, such as educational assessment, entertainment, or as a tool to help users learn new information.

To create this Java quiz program, I needed to have a basic understanding of the Java programming language and be familiar with concepts such as variables, control structures, and user input/output. I also needed to have a clear idea of the content and structure of the quiz I wanted to create.

To build the quiz, I needed to create a series of questions and responses, and write code to present them to the user in a logical order. I also wanted to include features such as a score tracker, feedback for correct and incorrect answers, or a timer to add an element of challenge to the quiz.
